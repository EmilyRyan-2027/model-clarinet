# Model Clarinet
This was my final project for a class called Computer Music Fundamentals that I took in Spring 2024.

## How to Play:

### Pitch Control: Keyboard
At the top of the patch, there are **keyboards** (ksliders) representing the fingering of a note in the Chalumeau (low) register, one keyboard showing concert pitch and the other showing written (transposed) pitch. Click the keyboard notes on either keyboard to play a note.

On the left side, use the **toggle** (box marked with an X) to open and close the register key. Opening the register key activates the Clarion (high) register, increasing the pitch of a given note by an octave plus a fifth.

### Articulation Mode
Under the register toggle is a **bang** (box marked with a circle) and a **drop-down**. Use the drop-down to select between three articulation modes.

- **Separated**: Individually articulated notes that ring for a specific length
- **Articulated**: Indivually articulated notes that ring until the next note starts
- **Legato**: No articulated attacks between notes, pitches change smoothly

Using the Separated or Articulated mode, you can click the bang for additional articulations of the current or most recent note.

### Playing Dynamic
Under the Articulation Mode selection is a **slider** for playing dynamics, marked on a scale from ***ppp*** (pianissimo) to ***fff*** (fortissimo). Use this slider to make your notes *softer and darker* or **louder and brighter**!

### Tone Gain & Noise Gain
Below the keyboards, there are **number fields** representing tone gain and noise gain. Use these to control how much you hear the clear tone vs. the fuzzy, reedy noise of the clarinet. Default levels are 1 for tone and 1.75 for noise.

### Note Length
To the right of the fields for tone gain and noise gain, there is one remaining **number field** for note length. This controls the length of notes in ms when using the "Separated" articulation mode.

### Pitch Control: Slider
On the top right of the patch, there is a slider representing 'continuous' pitch. Use the slider to emulate glissando (gliding smoothly between two notes), vibrato (pitch that noticably wavers around one note), and any other flexible pitch effects I am currently forgetting about.

### Reverb
This is the iconic yafr reverb!

## Have fun!
